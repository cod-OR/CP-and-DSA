# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms And CP

Hi,
I started my Competitive programming journey in January 2020. 
Since then I have come across many methods and algorithms as well as some time-saving-techniques.
I intend to gather as much of them as possible in this repository for my use and, of course, for the community.
All contributions and comments are welcome.
